# Coin-Flip
## Flip a coin. Will you get heads or tails?
### Once the page is open, simply press the space bar to flip the quarter. Once pressed, the coin will begin spinning in the air, a sound will play, and then it will randomly land on heads or tails, and print that.
This was a group project for an Introduction to Programming class at Emmanuel College by Joe Corleto and Jonathan Torres - Lopez.
